# VRChat-Logs
vrchat api + discord webhook <br>
I've been using it for 3 days now and haven't encountered any problems.

### How is it useful?
- Keep logs of your friend's activities in this way.

### **Forewarning**
- You can adjust the duration but do not make queries to the API more than once per 60 seconds.
- Abuse of the API may result in account termination.
- If something happens to your account that's your fault.

### How to use?
- Just put your cookies and discord webhook api into the .env file.
- It's ready to use.

I hope it's not have a problem.
